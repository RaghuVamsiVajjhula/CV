The cv means computer vision which is supported in C, c++, python languages.
We can simply give a vision to a computer in order to understand the images which you give to it.

It is used in detection of images and locations.


Our computer sees all our images in a form of matrix.

The matrices in python are used efficiently using numpy.

pip install opencv-python
